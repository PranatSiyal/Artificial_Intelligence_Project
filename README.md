# Stories on the GO
***
Here we have designed a mobile application, which allows the user to generate a story, only requiring keywords as the prompt instead of long descriptive paragraphs and attempt to keep the story coherent. We achieve this by integrating a recommendation system in our application, which suggests users appropriate keywords based on their previous inputs to keep the story consistent.
